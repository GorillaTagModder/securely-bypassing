# securely-bypassing
in this repository I'm showing you how to bypass securly, WORKING AS OF December 2024

FIRST METHOD IS TO USE `INSECURLY BY BYPASSI`
simpy clict on one of the links below, once clicked an embed should come up at the top of your screen saying `"this exploit was found by bypassi`` the icons were made by ender (https://github.com/Ender-Ghost-Craft/insecurly-icons)"` once done click ok. it should redirect you to `"INSECURLY exploit (by bypassi)"` the black button that says `"drag this button into a new tab!"` do what it says, it a page should pop up, and there should be a `button`, `"securly is currently" then a flip switch, if green securly is on, if gray it is off.`
links here if they dont work, and redirct you to a blocked securly page, that means your chromebook version isnt compatable, and I cant do anything about it

SECOND METHOD

Bookmarklets, bookmarklets are bookmarks that allows you to execute java scripts on just a new tab, most schools dont allow this, but there is a way.

# uRun - Bypass bookmarklet restrictions with an adblocker
## Why
Recently Google, cracked down on bookmarklets and now they don't work (Its based on the [DeveloperToolsAvailability](https://chromeenterprise.google/policies/?policy=DeveloperToolsAvailability) policy). I wanted to run scripts still so I started making this, inspired by [3kh0/Ext-Remover's uBlock exploit](https://github.com/3kh0/Ext-Remover?tab=readme-ov-file#ublock-run-run-code-on-pages), but with more features, like saving scripts.
# NOTE! WHEN YOU USE THIS METHOD, YOU CANT HAVE ADBLOCKER ENABLED, LIKE SECURLY, I HAVENT TESTED ANYTHING ELSE, YOUR ALLOWED TO OPEN UBLOCK ORIGIN AND CONFIGURE SETTINGS, BUT WHEN YOU USE THE KEYBOARD SHORTCUT I HAVE YOU USE, IT WILL OPEN AN ABOUT BLANK WITH A BLOCKED PAGE!
## Installation
1. Open uBlock settings
2. Enable advanced settings, and click the gear ⚙️ button

> [!CAUTION]
> DO MODIFY ANYTHING ELSE ON THIS PAGE, UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING (you probably don't), AS YOU COULD BREAK SOMETHING.

> [!TIP]
> If you mess up, go to the home of settings and at the bottom click reset to default settings

3. Add the script
> Change
> ```
> userResourcesLocation unset
> ```
> to
> ```
> userResourcesLocation https://eaglenetwork.github.io/uRun/urun.js
> ```

> [!TIP]
> It's down the bottom
4. Set a filter to load uRun
> After closing the advanced settings tab, go to the filters tab and add this:
> ```
> *##+js(urun.js)
> ```

## Usage
Simply press Ctrl + Shift + \` to open the menu and from there you can run and create scripts. To add a script, press the ➕ button up the top right, and enter the code you would like to add (without the `javascript:` part).
