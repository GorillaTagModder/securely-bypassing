# securely-bypassing
in this repository I'm showing you how to bypass securly, WORKING AS OF December 2024

FIRST METHOD IS TO USE INSECURLY BY BYPASSI
simpy clist on one of the links, once clicked an embed should come up at the top of your screen saying "this exploit was found by bypassi, and the icons were made by ender (https://github.com/Ender-Ghost-Craft/insecurly-icons)" once done click ok. it should redirect you to "INSECURLY exploit (by bypassi)" the black button that says "drag this button into a new tab!" do what it says, it a page should pop up, and there should be a button, "securly is currently" then a flip switch, if green securly is on, if gray it is off.
links here if they dont work, and redirct you to a blocked securly page, that means your chromebook version isnt compatable, and I cant do anything about it

SECOND METHOD

Bookmarklets, bookmarklets are bookmarks that allows you to execute java scripts on just a new tab, most schools dont allow this, but there is a way.
